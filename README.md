Just like all my current works, this is a combined script that only combines and tweaks the orignal ones. 
I do not own the original scripts so massive thanks to the makers of the following scripts for allowing them to be open source and making them available for use
-autocards and localized languages https://github.com/LewdLeah/
changes
it now allows output to pop up tab even if other scripts are displaying to it as well

 -True Auto Stats https://github.com/Yi1i1i/True-Auto-Stats-for-AIDungeon-RPG-Scenarios
 changes
 Added to option to add key triggers to skills to avoid having to type long skill names after they have evolved
